# FEFD-yolov5
The FEFD-YOLOV5 algorithm enhances detection performance by adding a shallow detection head specifically for small target detection and incorporating an SENet 
channel attention module to compress global spatial information, thus improving the modelâ€™s mean average precision (mAP) in corresponding scenarios.
